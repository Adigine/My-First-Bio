  <h1>David Levy</h1>
  <p>I was born in a very standard place but have been to very interesting places.
    That makes me an interesting person whom you should admire.
  </p>
  <p>For example, I have been to New Haven, Connecticut. It's true!
    I have also been to Atlanta, Georgia, and not just the airport.
